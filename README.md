Whitelisting Tools for ModSecurity
======================

Tools to simplify the creation of a whitelist for Apache's ModSecurity when used in with the Open Web Application Security Project's Core Rule Set (OWASP CRS).

At present, the project is a commandline tool <code>auditlog2db</code> that reads the ModSecurity audit log file into a SQLite database.

Future development aims to add a GUI and a wizard for whitelist creation, to reduce the barrier to entry for amateur users.
